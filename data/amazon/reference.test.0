this is honestly the only case i ve thrown away in the garbage
shame on what otherwise has been a reliable company with several other respectful products
it s like i got an extension cord and male outlets on both ends
it was supposed to be a complete toy
so i guess it s really a matter of preference
this case is far from what i expected
obviously we all have our own preferences for taste
the cables seem rather basic and work well , except one problem
i am actually afraid to open the remaining jars
these make great little night lights for the kids
i don t see what others have liked about this
the directions were easy to follow but the quality of the easel was pathetic
there was almost nothing i liked about this product
this just doesn t have enough power to massage my shoulders and neck
two days later i no longer saw them anywhere on the building
we re too stupid to put together normal sounding sentences
amazon was good to give me a refund right away
after four days of that , i gave up and chucked it
it worked for maybe num_num months then died
i used this along with another similar product , for over num_num months
i guess it fails in the truth department on its advertising
the shape of the grains makes all the difference
i woke up with basically an oil slick on my face
i also tried a cheaper brand of slip on rubber broad heads
it was all potatoes and had very little clam flavor
i do not like this belt because of lack of material
don t waste your time or money on these jeans
they also make noise if you happen to touch one against the other
i m sure it depends on your age and body type
worse , the controls are so confusing that it gives me a headache
these are supposedly cotton , but they don t feel like it
my husband said it was obvious so i had to return it
he enjoys this toy , but can get the treats out fairly quickly
i simply treated it how i would assume a curling iron works
i ve not been terribly impressed with this box
hardly something i would give as a wrapped birthday gift
i won t give this to the new puppy i m getting
spent more time fiddling with this than i did looking at the road
multiplayer is just as bad , though thankfully not worse
this one sits on our shelf collecting dust
if your bike had a kickstand on the plate it won t lock down
might work for others , didn t work for me
just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake
the bowl is too light we even had it on a rubber mat
in num_num thq came out with this wrestling game
i don t know why it has all the good reviews
this game offers nothing unique and the graphics are not worth raving about
there s no way this will last as long as claimed
does not give me any confidence in buying any of the discovery kids toys
after that you have to pay a subscription
i ordered these from amazon since i could find them nowhere in my area
other brands in this large of a container are glass
another energy product that simply wastes our money
generally if a toy makes noise , i don t mind so much
it reminds me more of silly putty than of a concealer
so after two months of use , working in it
this is just a little too low quality
then contact sharp and go on from there
most products are for dandruff caused by dry scalp
the concept was great and it worked very well when it worked
the graphics are most definitely improved over the previous version
a little at first , more with each successive try
unfortunately i m not sure what all the five star reviews are for
i will add an update if i ever figure it out
it not educational or exciting and it s annoying
if you get these just be a bit careful
unfortunately this product did not do much for me
speedloader is very hard to use especially with an extended magazine
i purchased this jawbone hd as a replacement for an older jawbone thinker
also , it creates more static than the one i m used to
the buttons to extend the arms worked exactly one time before breaking
i ve been through so many of these ineffective silly things
and after all that , the base broke too
i would suggest a more tropical flavor with chilled water
because it is definitely not worth full price
a process that takes a couple of minutes
there is no menu selection for find free books
avoid the heartache and wasted titme of bad discs
old grandson loves all things that have to do with construction
when i contacted the company the response was that they shipped it
you dont get so much sand with this
we have been treating our hair for months and finally got this
surely not worth what was paid for it by half
i spent $ for the num_extend and overall it was not worth the cost
i then emptied th coffee grinder and looked for an obstruction , none
and , there were many things we liked about this game
i have num_num bird feeders hanging from poles in my front and back yard
very well designed and easy to figure out
i had high hopes for this product since i bruise easily
the did not a aborb water at all
the radtach procable num_num inch dock extender works only part way
they are thinner and retain memory than the older ones
the product is not durable but it might just be the one i received
for some reason it worked out terribly for me
that does not hold true for this product
this is a worthless item that makes no sense at all
since that time i have replaced the game
when you place the eye brow attachment on you can get a mixed cut
i agree with the others that this was tough to open
armada lacks the epic scope of similar games like homeworld or even starcraft
will break in over time though , it s rubber
the quality is declined quickly by heat exposure

also it gets very hot while plugged in , which freaked me out
its good that its made in canada rather than china
and still the focus was extremely soft or just plain terrible

i put in a password but router won t recoginize it
i think i will return and stick with wool gloves
overall it is inconvenient to keep the counter and the unit clean
it took three years three vets and over twelve hundred dollars spent before success
it takes several passes through some types of hair to cut it
the case fit okay but not attractive at all
if you can afford it step up to something that will last
these salmons are in water not vegetable oil
in this case , it s a big disappointment for num_extend
i did not buy from a num_extend party seller

flavor : it has some tangy notes , and overall not bad
i also have to hold the headphone cord to keep it from flapping around
if you are sensitive to maltodextrin , this isn t for you
it worked great for the first couple of weeks then it just stopped completely
i would not even give my current one away
then i put the cream on my feet especially around my toes and heels

it makes an annoying sound when it is on

i guess maybe there are some people that this product could help
first , i put them both under my tongue simultaneously

first of all , syrup shouldn t run , it should ooze

i purchased this based on rave reviews from others
they would flip off or get hung up due to poorly rolling wheels

it just smears it around until the water evaporates into the air
because these knives will greatly appreciate on the collector s market

it scrolls way too easily and way too smoothly

i did not like the adjustable heat option for the warming plate

you need to use the towel it comes with to clean the phone before placement

it is the worst thing for slicing potatoes for scalloped potatoes and chips
however , this is an example of how rosie got it wrong

pretty much almost all i ask for in a grinder
you try to place all the ingredients into the bread maker
the charger is so far working with my wireless bluetooth speaker
the head set is not very comfortable at least for me
one hour per slice seems like a awful pace so far
you do have to hold a bowl when unpleasantly catching the meat you re grinding
but for now , i am very displeased with this

i did not get this as a gift for my son

we usually run it on low and it is very loud
when purchased i discovered there was a worse product update : model num_extend
i sprinkle a little flour on the rolls before stamping to prevent sticking , but they still stick
if you order it by itself , shipping is terribly expensive
it would have been better if it was not way too big
it wont reconnect easily when you are in the num_extend
only bad things to say about this horrible innovation
i would not recommend this case to my friends
mixer just as loud
the cord is very sensitive to tangling
for the size , weight , and price it is not worth it

and do not remove part one of the screen until part two is applied if you do not want big troubles
my kitchen appliances are horribly taken care of
anker , do not like it
too small
a gas cooktop would be way more worse and a smooth cooktop would probably not be much better
anyway i do not recommend this one for its high price and low quality
i purchased this to replace a knife that was broke
this is the second one of these that i have had to purchase
these tongs seem to have the locking mechanism backwards and do not work
i have tried a lot of them and this was disappointing
on the other hand for power grating it does not work

everything seems to stick and it is something you need to worry about
did not read any reviews

the shipping charges are now higher and missing on the order
seems cheap plastic to me
this turner has worked pretty poorly for the last few years
no warranty , bad deal
then i got the zester which i never use
i do not think that is the way to keep the fish moist
i have not been able to use it
it has a more bulky feel as the other cases available
that said , the mic did not pic up everything it could
however , slicing up tons of veggies is quite time consuming
unfortunately , the remaining sticker is attached to the second film
they do not work as well as expected
because it is made of cast iron , scorching is maximized

the tiny green light on one side is way too bright when fully charged
i had it a long time now and i still find it useful
i get oil all over my hands when cooking up a steak or falafel
wow im happy with this device ! how useful it is
the glass cuisinart lids would pour water everywhere in a wet mess all the time
i have realistic expectations of this device that were not met

not sturdy with a bad selection of teeth sizes
otterboxes are extremely bulky , and they do not protect well for the price
i ve had this thermometer for just num_num years
and it s much much expensive than getting it at the cusinart parts site
somehow fair price x x x x x x x x xx x
i dislike it more then any of the forman items
i will never have a phone with an otterbox again
the big thing is that it stretches easily , so you have to be careful with that
with grandchildren , this is a horrible combo of color and functionality
slightly better than block and tackle type hooks to store overhead

i purchased the frieling to try to replace a glass bodum press that broke
one corner is slightly taller than the other and it is noticeable

after using a blade grinder for years , i was not happy with this burr grinder
it charges my phone very slowly and to an incomplete % battery
the copper finish is coated with a not nice to see plastic to prevent oxidation
make sure the pins do not line up with the contacts

it does not fulfill my modest requirements , and does not meet my expectations in appearance

like i said , it does not , these are not ok
wrapped poorly
this pan i have only had for one year

but the back side looks terrible as well
i dislike that this griddle doubles as an indoor grill
i use these reviews so heavily that i do not want to give back
adds a huge amount of bulk to your phone
hard to keep clean and a real piece of junk
researched before i bought it and had actually chosen another one , but was wrong
there are way too many bright leds for taking pictures or just as a flashlight
this happened after only a couple of days of use

this does not keep the cord out of the way and above the board
i can not charge my phone quickly
this salad spinner is not durable and tough to use
the sound is also surprising for the price and is somehow enough for me
horrible quality

i would not even give these measuring spoons as a stocking stuffer for a college student
i have read reviews from wine experts that it does not work at all
i had many problems with both pieces and do not recommend the products
it is somewhat difficult to clean or assemble
one feature is that the spatula head is removable for cleaning
i completely doubt that it will hold up even for a few weeks
plus it is amazon and they will put there name on any piece of junk
this does not cuts down on waste that much but you don t have to ingest harmful propellants
oxo is the worst
i really do not like how this counter protector curves over the edge of the counter
this is one of the worst vacuums ive ever come across
the aluminum ones get unpleasantly stained and ugly after a few uses
it s also a decent size for a family of num_extend
